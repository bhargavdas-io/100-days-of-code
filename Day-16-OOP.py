### OOP Concept and Turtle graphics


#import turtle

#timmy = turtle.Turtle()    # Assigning a class to a variable, the variable is the "Object" now. Classes are written in Pascal class
                          # ie. The first letter is in caps.

# or, in simplified way:

#from turtle import Turtle,Screen
#timmy = Turtle()
#timmy.shape("turtle")
#timmy.color("red")
#timmy.forward(100)
#my_screen = Screen()

#print(my_screen.canvheight)
#my_screen.exitonclick()
