# functions, code blocks and while loops

# Functions:
# Defining functions:
# def my_function():
#   # do this
#   # then do this
#   # finally do this

# Using the function (calling):
# my_function( )



# while loops:
# while something_is_true:
#   do this  
# 
# 
#  Difference between for loops and while loops and when to use them
#  for loops are used, when we want to iterate over some elements and want to do something
#  with each of the elements.
#  But, in while loops, while the same is possible, we use it to iterate over something over and over
#  until the rule we set isnt false.
#  also, while loops are more succeptable to "infinite loops":
#  eg:
#      while 5>3:
#         print("Hello")
#  In this case, 5 is always going to be greater than 3, so Hello will be printed infinitely, cause it 5 > 3 can never be false
